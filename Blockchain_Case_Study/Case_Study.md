# Case Study: Decentral Inc.

## Background

Decentral Inc. is an innovation hub for disruptive and decentralized technologies. Decentral was home to Canada’s first two-way Bitcoin ATM and products Jaxx Classic and Jaxx Liberty.

In late 2013 Anthony Di Iorio funded & co-founded Ethereum, the decentralized smart contract platform that at its peak hit $150 billion in market cap. In 2014 he founded what is now Decentral Inc. Decentral is the maker of Jaxx Classic & Jaxx Liberty, digital asset platforms that empower millions of people with the tools they need to control their digital lives.

Decentral was founded in 2014 with the goal of becoming an innovation hub for disruptive and decentralized technologies. In just four years, the organization has created a community of hundreds of partner projects, most notably spawning leading blockchain Ethereum, and developing Jaxx, the foremost multi-platform, multi-currency cryptocurrency wallet, which actively engages more than 750,000 monthly users around the world. In the pursuit of unprecedented transparency and trustworthiness in the modern commercial ecosystem, Decentral intends for its new platform to empower the general public to take control of their digital lives by maintaining full control of their data. </br>

# Jaxx product
The company's flagship product Jaxx is a multi-token blockchain interface that provides a unified experience across eight platforms and devices. Decentral's strategic approach means Jaxx neither holds nor has access to customer funds. Driven by design and user experience and built with simplicity in mind, Jaxx's mission is to become the interface to the blockchain world. </br>

# Jaxx Liberty product
Jaxx Liberty is a cryptocurrency wallet that redefines the way people manage, secure, and interact with their digital assets. Jaxx Liberty overcomes the fragmentation in the cryptocurrency landscape by providing users a single, unified experience for accessing the tools they use day-to-day to manage their digital lives across more than 85 cryptocurrencies. </br>

## Security 
Jaxx Liberty is a non-custodial blockchain wallet, built around a business model that does not collect users’ personal information and respects their autonomy. It uses industrial standard wallet data generation and derivation processes. The 12-word mnemonic is generated using standard BIP39 library. To further protect data, extra security measures are implemented by encrypting core wallet data using bank grade encryption. </br>

## Why the need for such a product
There are thousands of coins in the world of cryptocurrency. Because of this overwhelming amount, wallets need to be capable of properly handling them. What’s more, the ideal wallet of this nature should be able to manage more than one coin type. An ability like this makes it incredibly convenient, as well as appealing to consumers. 

This wallet is a great choice for those in the world of cryptocurrencies that are beginners. Even with that advantage, it is still a favorite among crypto users that have more experience. </br>

## Additional Features
A notable feature is ShapeShift integration, which allows users to effortlessly switch between different cryptocurrencies. Moreover, they can do so without any exchange fees or delays.

Probably one of the most appealing features of this wallet is its ability to store and transact with different cryptocurrencies. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from. Because of this, it’s not uncommon for users to possess several of them at once. So, by being capable of keeping them all in the same wallet, it makes the wallet solid and convenient. </br>
